Electronics engineer based in Spain. I have experience in data acquisition with knowledge of Python and MatLab for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, with knowledge of biotechnologies oriented to robotic equipment to assist patients with disabilities or motor diseases.

I'm passionate about having a positive impact on people's lives or the environment. Therefore, I like to work on projects related to robotic prostheses and exoskeletons. And I also love teaching, especially maths. Furthermore, I enjoy writing stories and taking photos.
 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to work

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I'm interesting in sharing knowlege and learning from others. 

âœ¨ Work in progress: personal blog.
